Simple Auto Attack makes holding the attack button auto attack entities you're aiming at.

## Description

Simple Auto Attack is a Minecraft Fabric mod designed to automate the melee combat process. It allows players to perform automatic attacks when an entity is within range of the player's crosshair. This mod ensures that players can continue their combat without having to manually click the attack button repeatedly, making fighting more fluid and efficient. However, **use this mod responsibly** and do not use it on multiplayer servers unless allowed by the server's rules.

## Features

Makes the combat similar to the combat snapshots and adds some QOL features.

- **Automatic Attack** when weapon cooldown is finished and aiming at entity
- **Attack through grass**
- **No attack resetting** doens't hit grass or blocks, which makes cave combat easier
- **Prevent block breaking** (with swords, tridents and the mace), prevents attack resetting

Configureable with [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)

## Details
Prevents block breaking when holding items with the SWORD tag or items that have trident or mace in their name, so it should support most modded weapons.

## Warning

⚠️ **Do not use this mod on multiplayer servers as it might be considered a cheat.**

Using this mod on public servers might trigger the anticheat and result in a ban. I do not support or endorse any form of cheating, exploiting, or unfair advantage in online gameplay.
